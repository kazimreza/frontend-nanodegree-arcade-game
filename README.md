===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

    This is the third project for Udacity's FEND program. Create Frogger - style game, using Object Oriented Concepts, JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

    Game uses HTML5 Canvas to layout the game board and using OOC and JS to control enemy and player objects.

    Game Board
        Three distinct areas
    1-	Starting Area
    2-	 Primary Game Area (center of canvas)
    3-	Winner Circle

    Basic Operation
    -	Player starts at starting area, travels through the primary game area and avoiding collision with enemies and reaches the winner circle. 
    -	Player movements are controlled by ‘Left – Right – Up – Down’ directional arrows, located bottom right of standard keyboard. Operation instructions are also displayed on the left of game canvas.
    -	Reaching winner circle, prompts green ‘WinneR’ message on the left of game board and resets the game for replay
    -	Collision with enemy, prompts red ‘LooseR’ message on the left of game board and resets the game for replay

    Reviewed several online sites, reviewed Udacity online forum and  Google+ forum to get better understanding of the concepts. Still not completely clear with some of the concepts, need a lot of practice to get better command of JS coding concepts
    
    I Got Basic Understanding of Following Programing Concepts from this Exercise:
    -	HTML5 Canvas
    -	Object Oriented Programing Concepts
    -	JS Scopes, Closures, Prototype Chains, Functional & Prototype Classes, Pseudoclassical Patterns, Superclass & Subclass
